11/15/2021 10:08:45,aashen12,4,4,Submitted,4,5,"You need to describe your code, your implementation is n^2, which is sub-optimal.
You benhur histograms are buggy, k=4 doesn't make sense."
11/15/2021 10:18:27,albertqu,4,3,Submitted,3,3,"It's very hard to understand your code.
I think your implementation is buggy, your plot doesn't seem right."
11/17/2021 11:54:31,andleb,4,5,Submitted,4,4,"1. Inner product can be computed with less operations than N^2.
2. Really nice work on speed up, very through
3. Your replication might be a bit buggy comparing with the expected result (3 clusters should be the stable one). Furthermore you don't discuss the findings enough."
11/17/2021 12:15:24,austinvzane,4,5,Submitted,5,5,You could implement it faster than O(n^2)

11/17/2021 12:37:28,floricaconstantine,4,5,Submitted,4,5,"1. Your replication of Benhur has very low similarity, I suspect you have some bug. The fact that the random clusters are so similar in terms of similarity to the k-means ones, should have indicated to you that something is wrong."
11/17/2021 12:52:35,han9704,4,4,Submitted,3,4,"1. You didn't replicate the plot from Benhur
2. You stability scores are very low, indication of a bug.
3. I don't think plotting the clusters is of much use, when we talk about stability.
4. You hardly use any comments in your code, you use caps for variables
5. Your implementation is sub-optimal O(n^2)"
11/17/2021 13:26:16,hysk79,4,5,Submitted,4,5,"1. You implemented a sub-optimal solution O(N^2)
2. Your bi-modal distributions indicate some implementation bug. Think about lab 2, k=3 should be stable.

11/17/2021 13:30:06,ias5,4,5,Submitted,3,3,1. sub-optimal implementation O(N^2)
11/17/2021 13:39:26,ishaans99,4,5,,4,5,"1. Did not replicate the CDF plot
2. Sub-optimal implementation"

11/17/2021 14:01:36,jeremy-goldwasser,4,5,Submitted,5,5,1. sub-optimal implementation O(N^2)
11/17/2021 14:47:45,keyan3,4,4,,3,5,"1. sub-optimal implementation O(N^2)
2. could add a few more comments"
11/17/2021 14:59:50,licong-lin,5,4,Submitted,4,5,"1. When plotting the various histogram, you should use the same values on the x-axis.
2. You should add a few comments and better document your code."
11/17/2021 15:05:48,Mark-Oussoren,4,4,Submitted,4,5,"1. Your CDF plot is inconsistent with your histograms
2. Sub-optimal implementation O(n^2)
3. Could add some more comments in your code"
11/17/2021 15:26:30,mbowen97,4,4,Submitted,4,5,"1. I don't understand why you plot the similarity vs iteration, you should have replicated the plot in the paper.
2. I think your code is implemented incorrectly + no documentation"
11/17/2021 15:40:07,ssaxena00,4,5,Submitted,5,5,1. Sub-optimal implementation O(n^2)

11/17/2021 16:14:19,yuhaod,4,4,Submitted,5,5,"1. Did not submit cpp code
2. Better to add function signature"
